## 🚀 Features

- ⚙️ **CPU Scheduling Algorithms**
  - First-Come First-Serve (FCFS)
  - Shortest Job First (SJF) – Preemptive & Non-Preemptive
  - Priority Scheduling
  - Round Robin with configurable time quantum
  - Gantt chart visualization and average time analysis

- 📦 **Memory Management Algorithms**
  - First Fit, Best Fit, Worst Fit allocation
  - Visual memory block representation
  - (Optional) Page Replacement: FIFO, LRU, Optimal

- 📊 Real-time visual feedback
- 🎓 Educational design, beginner-friendly
- 🌐 Fully browser-based – no backend needed
